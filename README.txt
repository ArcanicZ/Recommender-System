How to run:
To run the program, go into command prompt, cd into the correct folder where hybrid.py is present in and the 
within the command line type "python hybrid.py" or just "hybrid.py".

Since my program is quite simple, it asks for a bar index for the user to choose a bar from. You can view the 
list of bars and their corresponding indexes by opening up the barIndexName.txt file which is present in the Data subfolder
